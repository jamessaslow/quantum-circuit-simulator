A simple two qubit quantum circuit simulator software with Grover's Algorithm as a unit test.

## Wavefunction Readability

I wanted to make the readability of the wavefunction very easy in this quantum software, and come up with a way to display my wavefunction in braket notation. Furthermore, I wanted to give the user the option to display their wavefunction in cartesian, or polar form.
