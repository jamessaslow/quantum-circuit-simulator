A simple two qubit quantum circuit simulator software with Grover's Algorithm as a unit test.

## Wavefunction Readability

I wanted to make the readability of the wavefunction very easy in this quantum software, and to display my wavefunction in braket notation. Furthermore, I wanted to give the user the option to display their wavefunction in cartesian or polar form. I was inspired to implement this becayse Qiskit, on the other hand, displays their statevectors as arrays. I believe not providing the option to include basis vectors and omiting zero-amplitude states can make the readibility of the wavefunction confusing.

## Grover's Algorithm

I implemented Grover's algorithm as a unit test to show the usefulness of the wavefunction readability at each step of the quantum algorithm.
