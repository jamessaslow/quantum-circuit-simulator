A simple two qubit quantum circuit simulator software with Grover's Algorithm as a unit test.

## Wavefunction Readability

I wanted to make the readability of the wavefunction very easy in this quantum software, and come up with a way to display my wavefunction in braket notation. Furthermore, I wanted to give the user the option to display their wavefunction in cartesian, or polar form. Qiskit, on the other hand, displays their statevectors as arrays, and I believe this can be confusing without displaying the basis vector next to its corresponding probability amplitude.

## Grover's Algorithm

I implemented Grover's algorithm as a unit test to show the usefulness of the wavefunction readability at each step of the quantum algorithm.
